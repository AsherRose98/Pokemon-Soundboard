# Pokémon Soundboard V1.0

## Description
This is a digital soundboard that I created in late 2017 loaded with all Pokémon battle cries from generation 1 through 5. It was built in Unity5 with C# for use by a local Pokémon Dungeons and Dragon campaign. It was created in part as a means for me to test out Unity when I first started using it.

The soundboard is in use by Jacksonville State University's Pokémon Table Top Role Play group. It took three days to create.

```
